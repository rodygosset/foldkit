# Query

:::Warning{label="Experimental"}
Query ships from `foldkit/experimental`. Its fetch and retention model is usable today, but names, types, Model shape, and lifecycle APIs may change before the module moves into Foldkit's stable API.

:::Info{label="See it in an app"}
To see how Query is used in a complete Foldkit application, visit [API Cache Query](/example-apps/api-cache-query). It includes a Query loaded during init, a KeyedQuery loaded by id, refreshes driven by a Subscription, and Story and Scene tests.
:::

## Overview

Fetching data in a Foldkit application usually takes the same pieces: an [AsyncData](/core/async-data) value in the Model, a Command that performs the request, a Message carrying the result, and update branches that begin and settle the request. That explicit loop is useful when a request belongs to a larger workflow. It becomes repetitive when the application only needs to retain a resource and refresh it later.

Think of Query as that standard request loop packaged around an `AsyncData` value. Query is a viewless Submodel: it owns the `AsyncData` state, fetch Command, completion Message, update logic, and protection against late responses. The parent stores the Query Model, delegates its Messages, and reads the retained `AsyncData` value for rendering.

A Query retains one resource, such as the current account or a list of posts. A KeyedQuery uses the same definition to retain separate entries for arguments such as post ids. Both keep successful data available while a refresh is pending or fails.

### When to Use Query

Use Query when a request produces one retained resource, or one entry in a retained collection, and the standard loading, refreshing, failure, and stale states describe its lifecycle. Use `AsyncData` directly when the result belongs to a larger application-specific transition, such as advancing a checkout or updating several Model fields. [When to Use AsyncData Directly](#when-to-use-asyncdata-directly) develops that distinction with an example.

### The Parent Controls Loading and Refreshing

The parent controls when a Query loads or refreshes. In response to one of its Messages—for example, a route change, button click, mutation result, or Subscription tick—it calls `loadIfMissing`, `revalidate`, or `revalidateOrLoad`. The Query operation checks the current `AsyncData` state and returns an update result containing either the unchanged Model or the next Model and a fetch Command.

Query does not react to rendering, expire data after a duration, poll, or refresh related resources on its own. The parent owns those decisions and expresses them through its Messages, update branches, and Subscriptions.

## Define a Query

Import the `Query` namespace from `foldkit/experimental`. Define the data and error Schemas, give the fetch a name, and provide the Effect that performs it:

::Snippet{name="queryDefine" label="Defining a Query for posts"}

With no `args`, `Query.define` returns a Query that retains one value. In this definition:

- `data` and `error` determine the `AsyncData` and Message Schemas.
- `execute` is the Effect the Runtime performs when it runs the generated fetch Command.
- `name: 'Posts'` gives the generated Command the name `FetchPosts` in DevTools and tests.

The `data` and `error` values must be Schema Codecs that require no encoding or decoding services. Query uses them to build its Model and completion Message Schemas.

The returned `postsQuery` owns a Model Schema, a Message union, and operations over that Model. Put `postsQuery.Model` in the parent Model Schema and use `postsQuery.init()` only when constructing the initial parent Model. The initial value is `Idle`.

### Connect the Query to Its Parent

The parent wraps the Query's Message and routes that wrapper back through a lifted fold. `lift` also adapts the loading operations so they read and write the Query field inside the parent Model:

::Snippet{name="queryLift" label="Connecting Query to its parent"}

The `parentField` form tells `lift` which field contains an always-present Query Model. `toParentMessage` wraps the result Message produced by the Query's fetch Command in the parent's `Got*Message` variant. `lift` returns the child fold and Query operations expressed in the parent Model and Message types. These functions return ordinary update results; they do not perform Effects.

- `posts.fold(model, message)` delegates the child Message to Query's update and writes the returned Query Model back to `model.posts`.
- `posts.loadIfMissing`, `posts.revalidate`, and `posts.revalidateOrLoad` apply their loading rule to the current `AsyncData`. When the rule calls for a request, the update result contains the next parent Model and a `FetchPosts` Command. Otherwise it contains only the unchanged Model.
- `posts.reset(model)` returns an update result whose parent Model contains an `Idle` Query value while preserving the Query's request identity.

Use the full lens form of `lift` when the Query is nested or exists only in some parent variants. Supply `read`, `write`, and `toParentMessage`, following the same contract as [`Update.foldChild`](/core/submodel#fold-child). When `read` returns `None`, the fold and lifted operations return the parent Model unchanged and no Commands.

Call a loading operation from init or a parent Message handler. In the example, init constructs the complete parent Model and passes it to `posts.loadIfMissing`. A route-change handler can return the same operation when a screen becomes active. Rendering the screen does not return a fetch Command or cause a request.

### Read and Render Query Data

Use `read` to access the Query's retained `AsyncData` value:

::Snippet{name="queryReadAndRender" label="Reading and rendering Query data"}

The parent passes the Query Model to a child-owned accessor; it does not inspect the Query Model's fields. `read` returns an ordinary `AsyncData`, and the parent decides how to render it with `AsyncData.match`, `matchData`, `getData`, `getError`, or another Async Data helper. A viewless Submodel preserves the state and update boundary without creating an `h.submodel` view boundary.

## Load and Refresh Query Data

Query provides three operations for loading and refreshing data. Each operation applies its transition rule to the current `AsyncData` state. When that rule calls for a request, the operation returns the next Model together with the fetch Command. The Runtime performs that Command after it receives the update result. A first load enters `Loading`; a refresh enters `Refreshing` and keeps the previous data available.

| Current state           | `loadIfMissing` | `revalidate`       | `revalidateOrLoad` |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `Idle`, `Failure`       | enter `Loading` | no change          | enter `Loading`    |
| `Loading`, `Refreshing` | no change       | no change          | no change          |
| `Success`, `Stale`      | no change       | enter `Refreshing` | enter `Refreshing` |

The no-change cases return no Command. Calling the same operation again while its Query is pending therefore does not duplicate the request. A KeyedQuery applies this check to the selected entry, so different keys may load concurrently.

When the Command finishes, the Runtime dispatches Query's `CompletedFetch` Message through `toParentMessage`. The parent wrapper branch calls `fold`, and Query settles the pending value:

- A successful first load becomes `Success`.
- A failed first load becomes `Failure`.
- A successful refresh replaces the retained data and becomes `Success`.
- A failed refresh becomes `Stale`, keeping the previous data beside the error.

Query accepts a completion only when it belongs to the currently pending request. A late completion from older work cannot overwrite a newer result.

:::Warning{label="Development reloads"}
During a Vite development reload, Foldkit can restore the Model but cannot restart Commands that belonged to the previous runtime. A Query restored in `Loading` or `Refreshing` can therefore remain pending until a full browser reload starts the application again. The same limitation applies to any Model state backed by an in-flight Command.
:::

### Choose When the Parent Loads or Refreshes

Choose the operation that matches why the parent is loading or refreshing:

- Use `loadIfMissing` on first entry to a screen or entity when retained data should be reused without a background refresh.
- Use `revalidateOrLoad` for a Refresh or Retry action that should work whether data is present or absent.
- Use `revalidate` when an event affects only resources that have already loaded. A mutation result or interval tick can refresh visible data without cold-loading every related Query.

Automatic behavior is still ordinary Foldkit architecture. For interval refetching, a [Subscription](/core/subscriptions) dispatches a tick Message while a Model condition is true, and that Message calls `revalidate`. For retries, compose `execute` with Effect's retry and Schedule APIs. To refresh related resources after a mutation, have the mutation result Message call the appropriate loading operation for each affected Query. Query supplies the transition; the parent records the reason and chooses when it happens.

The [API Cache Query example](/example-apps/api-cache-query) shows all three shapes together: a Query loaded at startup, a KeyedQuery that retains post details by id, and a Query revalidated by a Subscription while its tab is active.

### Reset a Query

Call `reset` to clear a live Query. Do not replace a live Query Model with a fresh result from `init()`. Query uses a generation number to reject late completions. `reset` clears the data while preserving that request identity, so a request started afterwards cannot share a generation with work started before the reset.

`reset` does not interrupt a running Command. A completion that arrives while the reset Query is no longer pending is ignored. If the application needs the work itself to stop, use a hand-managed interruptible Command instead of relying on reset as cancellation.

## Define a KeyedQuery

Add a non-empty `args` record to `Query.define` when one definition should retain independent results for dynamic inputs. In this example, `fetchPost(postId)` is an Effect that fetches and decodes one `Post` using the same pattern as `fetchPosts` above:

::Snippet{name="queryKeyedDefine" label="Defining a KeyedQuery for post details"}

Adding `args` makes `Query.define` return a KeyedQuery. Each distinct argument key has its own `AsyncData` entry. The operations now receive the arguments they should act on:

- `postQuery.read(model.postDetails, { postId })` returns that entry's `AsyncData`, or `Idle` when the entry does not exist.
- `postDetails.loadIfMissing(model, { postId })` changes a missing entry to `Loading` and includes its fetch Command in the update result. An entry that already has data is unchanged.
- `postDetails.revalidate(model, { postId })` changes a data-bearing entry to `Refreshing` and includes its fetch Command. An entry without data is unchanged.
- `postDetails.revalidateOrLoad(model, { postId })` chooses the loading or refreshing transition from that entry's current state.

By default, KeyedQuery encodes the complete args value as the key. Object field order does not change the key; array order does. Two argument records with different values retain different entries.

Each `args` field has the same restriction as `data` and `error`: its Schema Codec must require no encoding or decoding services. KeyedQuery encodes args when it derives the default key.

Provide `toKey` when several argument values deliberately identify the same retained resource. Suppose the args are `{ postId: Schema.String, preview: Schema.Boolean }`, but `preview` changes only how the request is made. `toKey: ({ postId }) => postId` makes the preview and non-preview requests share one entry. A collision means sharing data and pending work, so omit a field only when that is the application's intended identity rule.

A KeyedQuery retains entries until `forget` removes a key, `retainOnly` changes the retained set, or `reset` clears all of them. It does not expire entries or cap their number automatically. The parent controls the retained set through its Model and Messages.

## Control Query Lifecycles

`replace` starts a new Fetch even when one is pending. It keeps available data on screen and advances the request generation, so the earlier Fetch cannot overwrite the replacement. On a settled Query, it uses the same transition as `revalidateOrLoad`.

`forget(model, args)` removes one KeyedQuery entry while preserving the generation counter. Forgetting and then loading the same key cannot reuse an older request's identity. Use `reset` to clear a plain Query or every entry in a KeyedQuery.

`retainOnly(model, argsList)` removes KeyedQuery entries outside the supplied keys. It preserves retained entries and their arguments, and does not fetch missing entries. An empty list removes every entry.

When the retained set follows parent Model state, apply `retainOnly` in the update handler that changes that state. Compose it with `loadIfMissing` to fetch the selected entry explicitly:

::Snippet{name="queryRetainOnly" label="Retaining the selected post"}

By default, these operations do not interrupt running Commands. A completion for a forgotten entry is ignored, and a later Fetch uses a new generation. The [API Cache Query example](/example-apps/api-cache-query) retains the selected post and clears its detail when the user returns to the list.

## Interrupt Pending Fetches

Set `interrupt: true` to stop pending Fetch Commands when entries are evicted or replaced. In this example, Cancel clears the posts Query and stops its pending Fetch. Reload replaces any pending Fetch with a new request:

::Snippet{name="queryInterrupt" label="Cancelling and replacing a posts Fetch"}

An interruptible Query's `init(instanceId)` requires a stable identifier for that Query instance within the application. Give independently mounted instances different identifiers. Fetch keys include the instance identifier and request generation, so cancelling an old request cannot stop a newer Fetch for the same entry. Default Queries keep `init()` and their existing Model and Message shapes.

`posts.reset(model)` immediately clears the retained value and returns an Interrupt Command when a Fetch is pending. The `fetchPosts` Effect above passes the abort signal supplied by `Effect.tryPromise` to `fetch`, so interrupting that Effect also aborts the browser request. KeyedQuery's `forget` and `retainOnly` cancel only the pending Fetches they evict.

When `replace` encounters pending work, it returns an Interrupt Command and keeps available data visible. The `GotPostsMessage` handler delegates `CompletedCancelFetch` through `posts.fold`, which starts the replacement even if the original Fetch has already finished. A stale cancellation cannot restart an evicted or superseded request.

An interruptible Query's `update` and lifted `fold` include its execute services in their return types because cancellation can start the replacement Fetch. Eviction operations require no execute services. Without `interrupt: true`, running Fetches finish and stale completions are ignored.

## Test Query Commands

The generated `Fetch` definition is public so Story and Scene tests can match and resolve the Command. Obtain application fetch Commands through `loadIfMissing`, `revalidate`, or `revalidateOrLoad`; calling `Fetch` directly would skip the Model transition and generation update that make completion handling safe.

The [API Cache Query example](/example-apps/api-cache-query) includes Story and Scene tests that resolve Query Commands without running their Effects.

## When to Use AsyncData Directly

Query fits a request whose result becomes one retained resource, or one entry in a retained collection, and whose lifecycle follows the standard loading, refreshing, failure, and stale states. Use `AsyncData` directly when the request result belongs to a larger application-specific transition. Common examples include success and failure driving different domain flows, one result updating several Model fields, user-controlled interruption, or a cache with its own eviction rules.

In this checkout, placing the order does more than retain the returned value. `Orders.place(orderDraft)` is the checkout's Effect for submitting an order. The application defines its result Messages and Command around that domain operation:

::Snippet{name="queryUseAsyncDataCommand" label="Defining the order Command and Messages"}

The Model owns the `AsyncData` field, and update handles each result as part of the larger checkout transition. Success stores the order and moves the application to its confirmation route:

::Snippet{name="queryUseAsyncDataUpdate" label="Handling order results in update"}

The [Async Data guide](/core/async-data) covers the state type, transitions, and rendering helpers used when the application owns this wiring.

The [Query API reference](/api-reference/experimental-query) lists the exact Query, KeyedQuery, `define`, `lift`, `read`, `reset`, and `run` signatures.
